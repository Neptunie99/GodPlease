## Source Code


   ### Module-A: Storm Surge Estimation

   - **A-1_TC-tracks Selection.py**: This script is used to select and preprocess synthetic TC tracks from the STORM Dataset.
   - **A-2_ADCIRC Batch Running.py**: This script is used to batch generate and run ADCIRC models.
   - **A-3_Annual Maximum Statistics.py**: This script is used to calculate the annual maximum storm surges.
   - **A-4_Return Period Calculation.py**: This script is used to estimate return periods of storm surges using GEV functions.

   ### Module-B: Combined Scenario Construction

   - **B-1_Combined Scenario.py**: This script is used to estimate the total water level under combined scenarios (mean sea level + astronomical tide + storm surge).
   - **B-2_Inundation Calculation.py**: This script is used to calculate inundation for combined scenarios.

   ### Module-C: Quantitative Risk Assessment

   - **C-1_Flood Area.py**: This script is used to calculate the flood areas for combined scenarios.
   - **C-2_Effected Population.py**: This script is used to estimate the affected population for combined scenarios.
   - **C-3_Economic Loss.py**: This script is used to estimate economic loss for combined scenarios.

## Processed Data
- `Select_250yr_buf200km.xlsx`: Selected TC tracks from the STORM dataset passing within a 200km buffer zone of Hainan Island over a 250-year period. This file includes fields such as original ID ("TCid"), re-encoded ID ("REid"), and year ("Year").
- `Record.rar`: Hourly records of selected TC tracks during the impact process, including fields such as latitude ("LAT"), longitude ("LONG"), minimum pressure ("MP"), maximum wind speed ("MWS"), and maximum wind radius ("RMW"). The data is compressed into a RAR file due to its large size.
- `MaxSurge/`: Maximum storm surges at all locations for each ADCIRC simulation.
- `MaxSurge_Year/`: Annual maximum storm surges at all locations based on the corresponding years of TC tracks.
- `MaxSurge_Return.csv`: Storm surges at all locations for 10-year, 20-year, 50-year, and 100-year return periods.
- `Inundation.rar`: Inundation data for 24 combined scenarios in TIFF  format. The naming rule is "inundation+[storm surge (5 characters)]+[astronomical tide (1 character)]+[sea level (4 characters)]+.tif". The data is compressed into a RAR file due to its large size.
- `CityArea/`: City flood area grouped by depth for 24 combined scenarios, measured in km<sup>2</sup>.
- `GeneralArea/`: General flood area grouped by depth for 24 combined scenarios, measured in km<sup>2</sup>. Scenarios with same astronomical tide and sea level are consolidated into a file.
- `CityRisk/`: City risk for 24 combined scenarios, including flood area (km<sup>2</sup>), affected population (million), and  economic loss (million $).
- `GeneralRisk/`: General risk for 24 combined scenarios, including flood area (km<sup>2</sup>), affected population (million), and  economic loss (million $). Scenarios with same astronomical tide and sea level are consolidated into a file.
